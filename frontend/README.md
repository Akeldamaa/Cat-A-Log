# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Setup
- Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/prebuilt-installer). You can skip this step if you already have node installed
- Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable). You can skip this step if you already have yarn installed
- Ensure you are in the frontend directory in your terminal
- Download all project dependencies using ```yarn```
- Start the development server using ```yarn dev```
- You can find an example on how to make API requests to the backend server [here](./src/components/TestApi.jsx). Ensure the backend server is running before making requests and the url matches the one in the backend server
